# Token Standards Implementation Checklist

## 🎯 QUICK START

### Choose Your Path:
1. **ERC-20** → Fungible tokens (currencies, governance)
2. **ERC-721** → Non-fungible tokens (NFTs, collectibles)  
3. **ERC-1155** → Mixed tokens (games, multi-asset)
4. **Neural Enhanced** → Biometric-secured tokens

### Priority Matrix:
| Urgency | Task | Time | Owner |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| 🔴 Critical | Security Audit | Week 1 | Security Team |
| 🟡 High | Gas Optimization | Week 2 | Dev Team |
| 🟢 Medium | Documentation | Week 3 | Docs Team |
